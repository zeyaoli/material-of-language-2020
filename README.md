## Assignment 1 - Colors of Domination

In the first assignment, our goal is to get familiar with python language and "create a composition based on computational manipulation of data."

When I brainstormed, I thought of Donna Haraway's *A Cyborg Manifesto*, especially the chapter THE INFORMATICS OF DOMINATION. This chapter talks about a new networks that we are transitioning to, and how do all the "old" class, race and gender transform to a new society. In the chapter, Haraway lists a few transitions from "the comfortable old hierarchical dominations (Organics of Domination) to the scary new networks of informatics of domination (Informatics of Domination)." For example, sex is transformed to genetic engineering in the new society; mind changes to artificial intelligence.

As what the word sounds like, the new society looks artificial. What I did in my simple sketch is that I take steps further and transform the word from strings to bytes, then convert the byte to image, then converts the color hex code back to texts. I call the new output "Colors of Domination." With letters and symbols, it tells a new story about how color thinks about the world.


Organics of Domination:   "representation", "bourgeois novel", "death", "heat", "public/private"

Informatics of Domination: "simulation", "science fiction", "surface", "noise", "cyborg citizenship"

Colors of Domination: "sim uk` sio n\x1f", "sci enc e\x1ff cti on\x1f", "suq f c d", "moi  se\x1f", "dyb org ci  siz ens gip"
